We are about to launch a coworking space at Nooitgedacht Village called the Village Hub. I want to create a webpage where people can register their interest, receive some information, see a few illistrative images etc. Attached is the logo and the presentation file. I have already created a previous page on google forms for reference, but please use your own layout - https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScsK_nsNQMhopC1ehpvD3u7Z8Q7FTgcAXw6zpzoPyQoIYyzjw/viewform?usp=sf_link
Use attached as a theme for colors and images for the website
Change the colors of the website, text, banners, buttons etc to be more like the colors on the attached color board
Use as logo
Make the logo 300% bigger
